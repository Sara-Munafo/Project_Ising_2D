- For the 1st method of finite size scaling: "fss.pdf" (up to page 8)
- For the 2nd method of finite size scaling: a simplified version of the 1st method, where I skipped the estimation of the critical temperature, and I just estimated gamma via a linear fit, by fitting logChi and logL (same relation of method 1 but with log)
- In the end, to check if the results were correct (not if they coincided with the theoretical values but if they respected the behaviour of our data) I used the technique of plotting the correlation function as instructed in "hw03.pdf" point e), with different exponents. If the procedure is correct, with the exponents found, the data should collapse into one curve which is the correlation function (it does with the exponents I found). Something on critical exponents and the correlation function can be also found in "PhaseTransitions.pdf" pages 16-17.
