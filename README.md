# Project_Ising_2D

The purpose of this article is to present a detailed numerical study of the second-order phase tran-
sition in the 2D Ising model. The importance of correctly presenting elementary theory of phase
transitions, computational algorithms and finite-size scaling techniques results in a important under-
standing of both the Ising model and the second order phase transitions. In doing so, Markov Chain
Monte Carlo simulations are performed for different lattice sizes with periodic boundary conditions.
Energy, magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility and the correlation function are calcu-
lated and the critical exponents determined by finite-size scaling techniques. The importance of the
correlation length as the relevant parameter in phase transitions is emphasized.
